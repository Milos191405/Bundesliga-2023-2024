# Bundesliga 2023/2024 Season Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end football data analysis of the Bundesliga 2023/2024 season.  
The goal is to analyze team performance, identify key success factors, and explain league outcomes through structured data analysis and visual storytelling.

The season is particularly interesting because **Bayer Leverkusen won the league undefeated**, providing a strong case for analyzing consistency, efficiency, and tactical balance rather than dominance in a single statistical category.

The project combines **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to move from raw data to actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Structure and clean raw Bundesliga team statistics
- Create analytical tables and derived metrics
- Identify correlations between performance metrics and league position
- Compare offensive, defensive, and physical performance
- Analyze Home vs Away consistency
- Explain league success through data-driven insights
- Present findings using interactive Power BI dashboards

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- **Official Bundesliga 2023/24 statistics**  
  https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/stats/overview/2023-2024  
  *(If the link does not open directly, copy and paste it into your browser)*

- Data manually collected and transformed into structured CSV files for analysis

---

## 📁 Data Files
- `statistics_2023_24.csv`  
  Team-level performance statistics (goals, shots, possession, passes, duels, physical metrics)

- `home_away_23_24.csv`  
  Home vs Away performance (points, wins, goals, goal difference)

- SQL scripts for analytical queries
- Python notebooks for exploration and visualization
- Power BI dashboards for interactive analysis

### 🔗 Project Data Files (Google Drive)
All structured datasets used in this project are available here:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OpOBN63IkiADnRSjakmCm7Vw45wNWlDc?usp=drive_link  

The folder includes:
- Combined team statistics  
- Home vs Away performance tables  
- Derived metrics and calculated indicators  
- Final datasets used for SQL analysis, Python exploration, and Power BI dashboards

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Efficiency matters more than volume**  
  Top teams convert chances more efficiently rather than simply creating more shots.

- **Possession and passing accuracy strongly correlate with success**, but are not the only winning styles.

- **Physical metrics alone do not guarantee results**  
  High running and sprint numbers must be supported by tactical structure.

- **Home & Away consistency is a major differentiator**  
  Bayer Leverkusen’s balanced performance explains their unbeaten title-winning season.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
With the addition of multiple Bundesliga seasons, this dataset could be expanded to support:
- Trend analysis across seasons
- More robust statistical comparisons
- Team profiling across multiple years

Machine Learning is considered a **future extension**, dependent on the availability of a larger historical dataset.
