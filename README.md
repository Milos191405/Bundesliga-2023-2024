# Bundesliga 2023/2024 Season Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze team statistics from the Bundesliga 2023/2024 season to identify trends, correlations, and performance patterns. The goal is to understand how different factors contribute to team success and provide valuable insights into playing styles, efficiency, and strengths.

## Objectives
- Collect and structure Bundesliga 2023/2024 team statistics.
- Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between key metrics.
- Cluster teams based on playing style, work rate, and defensive/attacking tendencies.
- Evaluate efficiency in goal scoring, passing, and sprinting.
- Identify standout teams and statistical outliers.
- Use historical data for predictive analysis of future performance.

## Planned Analysis
### 1. Correlation Analysis
We will explore relationships between key performance metrics to understand how certain factors contribute to success:
- **Do more shots lead to more goals?** (Correlation between "Shots" and "Goals")
- **Does higher possession lead to more successful passes?** (Correlation between "Possession (%)" and "Successful passes from open play (%)")
- **Do teams that run more (distance covered, sprints, intensive runs) perform better?** (Relation to goals scored, wins, or league position)

### 2. Performance Clustering
Using clustering methods, teams will be grouped based on:
- **Playing Style** (Possession-based vs. Counter-attacking teams)
- **Work Rate** (Distance covered, sprints, intensive runs)
- **Defensive vs. Attacking Tendencies** (Duels won, aerial duels, fouls committed)

### 3. Ranking Efficiency
Analyzing efficiency in different aspects:
- **Goal Efficiency** (Goals per shot or shots on target)
- **Passing Efficiency** (Successful passes vs. possession percentage)
- **Sprint Efficiency** (Sprints vs. distance covered)

### 4. Team Strength Profiling
Teams will be categorized based on their strengths:
- **Defensive Strength** (Fouls, duels won, aerial duels, yellow cards)
- **Attacking Strength** (Shots, goals, crosses)
- **Work Rate** (Distance covered, sprints, intensive runs)

### 5. Outlier Detection
Identifying teams that significantly deviate from the norm:
- Example: **VfL Bochum 1848** leads in yellow cards and duels won â€“ does this indicate an aggressive playstyle?

### 6. Predictive Analysis
Using historical data, we aim to:
- **Predict future team performance based on key metrics.**
- **Analyze whether teams with high-intensive runs maintain consistency in results.**

## Data Sources
- Bundesliga official statistics ([bundesliga.com](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/stats))
- Publicly available datasets

## Next Steps
1. Gather and structure data.
2. Perform statistical analysis and clustering.
3. Visualize insights with charts and tables.
4. Develop predictive models and validate results.
