# 📊 Bundesliga 2023/2024 Season Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze team statistics from the Bundesliga 2023/2024 season to identify trends, correlations, and performance patterns. The goal is to understand how different factors contribute to team success and provide valuable insights into playing styles, efficiency, and strengths.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and structure Bundesliga 2023/2024 team statistics.
- Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between key metrics.
- Cluster teams based on playing style, work rate, and defensive/attacking tendencies.
- Evaluate efficiency in goal scoring, passing, and sprinting.
- Identify standout teams and statistical outliers.
- Use historical data for predictive analysis of future performance. ?

## Planned Analysis
### 1️⃣ Correlation Analysis
We will explore relationships between key performance metrics and rank teams based on their efficiency:
- ⚽ Shots vs. Goals: Do more shots lead to more goals? Also, rank teams by goals per shot (goal efficiency).

- 📈 Possession (%) vs. Successful Passes: Does higher possession lead to more successful passes and goals? Rank teams by passing efficiency (successful passes per possession %).

- 🏃 Distance Covered & Sprints: Do teams that run more perform better? (Relation to goals scored, wins, or league position.)

### 2️⃣ Performance Clustering
Teams will be grouped using clustering methods based on:

- 🎮 Playing Style: Possession-based vs. Counter-attacking teams.

- 🏃‍♂️ Work Rate: Distance covered, sprints, and intensive runs.

- 🛡 Defensive vs. Attacking Tendencies: Duels won, aerial duels, and fouls committed.

###  3️⃣ Team Strength Profiling

Teams will be categorized based on their core strengths:

- 🛡 Defensive Strength: Fouls, duels won, aerial duels, yellow cards.

- 🎯 Attacking Strength: Shots, goals, crosses.

- 🏃 Work Rate: Distance covered, sprints, intensive runs.

### 4️⃣ Outlier Detection & Insights

Identifying teams that deviate significantly from league norms:

- 🔍 Example: If VfL Bochum 1848 leads in yellow cards and duels won, does this indicate an aggressive playstyle?

### 5️⃣ Predictive Analysis

Using historical Bundesliga data to:

- 📊 Predict future team performance based on key metrics.

- 🔄 Analyze consistency in results for teams with high work rates (e.g., intensive runs per match).
