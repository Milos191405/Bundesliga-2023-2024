# Bundesliga 2023/2024 Season Analysis

## ### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis

###    ‚öΩ **Shots vs. Goals:** Do more shots lead to more goals? Rank teams by **Goal Efficiency** (shots per goal) and analyze the strength of the correlation.

``` SQL
WITH avg_shots_to_score AS (
    SELECT
        position,
        team,
        goals,
        shots,
        CASE
            WHEN goals = 0 THEN NULL  
            ELSE ROUND(CAST(shots AS DECIMAL) / goals, 2)        
        END AS avg_shots_to_score
    FROM
        bundesliga_statistics
)

SELECT 
    position,
    team,
    goals,
    shots,
    avg_shots_to_score,
    (SELECT CORR(goals, shots) FROM bundesliga_statistics) AS correlation_shots_goals,
    (SELECT CORR(position, goals) FROM bundesliga_statistics) AS goals_position_correlation
FROM avg_shots_to_score
ORDER BY position;
```

From here we can see that team from the top of table have significantly more shots on goal and scored more goals. 
Best teams needed in average around 7 shots to score the goal. 
Like we expected here is really high correlation between goals and position on the table. 

| Position | Team                        | Goals | Shots | Avg Shots |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1        | Bayer 04 Leverkusen          | 89    | 616   | 6.92      |
| 2        | VfB Stuttgart                | 78    | 527   | 6.76      |
| 3        | FC Bayern M√ºnchen            | 94    | 628   | 6.68      |
| 4        | RB Leipzig                   | 77    | 534   | 6.94      |

| 8        | 1. FC Heidenheim 1846        | 50    | 393   | 7.86      |
| 9        | SV Werder Bremen             | 48    | 398   | 8.29      |
| 10       | Sport-Club Freiburg          | 45    | 396   | 8.80      |
| 11       | FC Augsburg                  | 50    | 437   | 8.74      |
| 12       | VfL Wolfsburg                | 41    | 406   | 9.90      |
| 13       | 1. FSV Mainz 05              | 39    | 471   | 12.08     |
| 14       | Borussia M√∂nchengladbach     | 56    | 446   | 7.96      |
| 15       | 1. FC Union Berlin           | 33    | 403   | 12.21     |
| 16       | VfL Bochum 1848              | 42    | 509   | 12.12     |
| 17       | 1. FC K√∂ln                   | 28    | 430   | 15.36     |
| 18       | SV Darmstadt 98              | 30    | 402   | 13.40     |

#### üîç **Key Insights: Goal Efficiency**  
- **Top Scorers, Top Positions:** The top three teams‚Äî**Bayer Leverkusen**, **Bayern M√ºnchen**, and **VfB Stuttgart**‚Äîlead in both total goals and efficiency, needing fewer than 7 shots per goal on average.  
- **Finishing Efficiency Gap:** Teams at the bottom of the table, such as **1. FC K√∂ln** and **SV Darmstadt 98**, require nearly double the shots per goal (13+), highlighting major finishing issues.  
- **Interesting Outlier:** **Borussia M√∂nchengladbach** shows good efficiency (7.96 shots/goal) despite a lower rank, indicating potential defensive weaknesses rather than attacking inefficiency.  



### ‚öΩ **Goal Efficiency Correlations**  
*Correlation between Shots, Goals, and League Position*  

| **Correlation Type**                     | **Correlation Value** | **Interpretation**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shots to Goals**                        | 0.8299               | ‚úÖ **Strong positive correlation:** More shots ‚Üí more goals.            |
| **Goals-Position Correlation**            | -0.9003              | üî• **Strong negative correlation:** Better-ranked teams score more goals. |



#### **Interpretation** 
*Correlation (Shots to Goals): The strong positive correlation of 0.8299 between shots and goals suggests that teams that take more shots tend to score more goals.*

*Goals-Position Correlation: The -0.9003 negative correlation between goals and position indicates that teams higher in the table tend to score more goals, while teams lower in the table score fewer goals.*

*Explanation of Negative Correlation: The negative correlation between goals and position occurs because the team in the first position (highest rank) has a negative correlation value, while the best teams typically occupy lower-numbered positions. A negative correlation confirms that higher-ranked teams (lower position numbers) score more goals, which aligns with expectations*

###  üìà **Possession (%) vs. Successful Passes:** Does higher possession lead to more successful passes and goals? Rank teams by **Passing Efficiency** (successful passes % per possession %) and assess the impact on league position. 
*Correlation between "Possession (%)", "Successful Passes from Open Play (%)", and Scored Goals.*
```sql
SELECT
    position,
    team,
    possession_percent,
    successful_passes_percent,
    CORR(possession_percent, successful_passes_percent) AS correlation_possession_passes,
    CORR(possession_percent, position) AS possession_position_correlation,
    CORR(successful_passes_percent, position) AS successful_passes_position_correlation
FROM
    bundesliga_statistics
ORDER BY
    position ASC;
```
Here is visible that the top team's have slightly higher Possession  and more successful Passes.




| Position | Team                     | Possession % | Successful Passes % |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------|

| 14       | Borussia M√∂nchengladbach  | 47.00        | 83.70               |
| 15       | 1. FC Union Berlin        | 44.00        | 79.90               |
| 16       | VfL Bochum 1848           | 47.00        | 81.40               |
| 17       | 1. FC K√∂ln                | 47.00        | 80.80               |
| 18       | SV Darmstadt 98           | 45.00        | 81.40               |

#### üîç **Key Insights: Possession & Passing**  
- **Possession Equals Performance:** Top teams (**Bayer Leverkusen**, **Bayern M√ºnchen**) dominate possession (58‚Äì59%) and have the highest successful pass percentages (89.8%), reflecting control-driven playstyles.  
- **Passing Accuracy Advantage:** The strong positive correlation (0.8738) shows that more possession significantly boosts passing accuracy.  
- **Exceptions to the Rule:** Teams like **Eintracht Frankfurt** and **TSG Hoffenheim** achieve mid-table results with lower possession, suggesting alternative tactics like counter-attacking play.  


### üéØ **Possession & Passing Correlations**
